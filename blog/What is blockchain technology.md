# 1. What is blockchain technology?

Blockchain technology is a data storage technology that cannot be forged, changed, or hacked in summary with data distribution processing technology.
Satoshi Sakamoto recognized the risks of the centralized financial system through the 2007 global financial crisis and devised a blockchain technology that enables transactions between individuals.
In 2009, we developed Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, by applying blockchain technology.
This is the beginning of blockchain technology and the birth of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency.
Current financial transactions, for example, store and prove financial records in a huge system called banks, and all consumers who do business with banks suffer losses in the event of accidents such as bankruptcy, hacking, and natural disasters, but conversely, in the case of blockchain technology,
It is a technology that allows safe and transparent transactions without having to go through intermediaries by distributing and storing records on numerous computers without storing them in one system.
Each computer has the advantage of being able to encrypt and store records, so hacking is impossible because it is virtually impossible to hack all encrypted computers even if you try to hack.

**1-1 Type of blockchain**. 

Blockchain is largely divided into public blockchain and private blockchain. The public blockchain is open to everyone and anyone can participate, and virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are representative.
The private blockchain is operated by an institution or company and can only be used by those who have obtained prior permission. It has the advantage of being relatively fast because the number of participants is limited.

**1-2 Blockchain Utilization Plan**. 

Since the information stored in the blockchain is diverse, there is also a wide area where the blockchain can be used.
In general, it is used for virtual currency that stores currency transactions as blocks, transmits transactions to all users participating in the transaction, and prevents data forgery by comparing them with each transaction.
It can also be used in various areas that require reliability, such as electronic payment and digital certification, cargo tracking system, P2P loan, distribution origin or genuine art sentiment, anti-counterfeiting, electronic voting, electronic citizenship issuance, vehicle sharing, real estate register, and hospital-to-hospital medical records.

**1-3. Terms related to blockchain.**. 

**- Block**. 
A block is a unit for storing data and is divided into a body and a header. The body contains transaction details, and the header contains encryption codes such as Merklehash or nonce (any number related to encryption). Blocks are generated every about 10 minutes, and they are connected to the previous block while verifying reliability by attracting transaction records to form a blockchain. The block that first started here is called the Genesis block. In other words, the Genesis block refers to the first block in which no block was created in front of it.  
**- Node**. 
Blockchain does not store and manage transaction records on a centralized server, but individual servers participating in transactions gather to maintain and manage the network. This individual server, that is, the participant, is called a node. Since there is no central manager, the role of the node distributing the block is important, and a new block is created only with the consent of at least half of the participating nodes. Nodes have blockchain stored on their computers, and even if some nodes are hacked and the existing content is wrong, data remains in many nodes, so data can be preserved continuously.  
**- Hash function**. 
It is a function that derives results of the same length no matter what data is entered. It is unlikely that the derived result overlaps, and it is difficult to inversely estimate the input value as the result value. For this reason, comparing hash values can determine whether data changes have occurred. The hash function is a more advanced form of SHA-2 (SHA 256) after the first SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)-1 was devised, which is used in the blockchain. SHA-2 results in 256 bits no matter what length of value is entered.
