## 1. What is Di-Fi?

Defi stands for decentralized finance, which means decentralized or decentralized finance, and in short, is a new concept of finance using Bitcoin.
The existing financial system through banks is called C-Fi centralized finance, and decentralized finance is called De-Fi with De in front of it.
Since DPI does not need an intermediary, it can be invested with interest without banks, securities firms, or credit card companies, and payment is possible. Financial services such as deposits, loans, investments, and insurance are all operated on a blockchain basis.
Existing financial transaction records have been preserved and recorded by such financial institutions, but DeFi proves the transaction on the blockchain.
Since everyone shares transaction records, there are no forgery, alteration, or issues, and the remittance fees received by intermediaries are much cheaper.
In terms of access to the financial system, complex procedures such as identification, regardless of borders or location, are not necessary for DPI and have the great advantage of running 24 hours a day, unlike banks and securities firms.
In addition, real assets, which were previously impossible to liquidate, can be sold through the tokenization process, making it easier for assets such as artworks and real estate to be included in the financial system.
The irreplaceable token (NFT) is a technology that makes it impossible to forge or falsify by issuing ownership of a specific digital file in the form of a blockchain, and the blockchain acts as a kind of "digital certificate."
Previously, it was not easy to prove ownership of real assets split, but for example, even if 10,000 won worth of works were invested in 10 billion won each, it was difficult to prove ownership, but if you use NFT, you can verify ownership without having to discuss legal permission or certification.

### 1-1 Decentralized Exchange: UNI

Euniswab has a total market capitalization of $9.8 billion, the largest among DPI coins.
Euniswab is a decentralized exchange (DEX).
All stock exchanges, and coin exchanges such as Upbit and Bipsum, are centralized exchanges (CeFi), where exchanges broker investment products for fees from investors.
In the case of Euniswab, you can invest in products through Euniswab without a central system, and coin developers can sell Ethereum utility tokens developed by themselves through Euniswab. In other words, it acts as an exchange for new coins.
Thanks to traders on the network, there are no special listing screening or listing requirements like existing exchanges.
Anyone can purchase utility tokens by installing the Ethereum Wallet, and transactions are conducted individually and individually (P2P).
The decentralized exchange is drawing attention because investors who sell tokens receive fees during the transaction process, which is proportional to the amount of tokens sold up to 0.3%-1%. This is possible because there is no central institution such as the exchange in return for the liquidity provision needed for Euniswab to run.

### 1-2. Loan: AVE

Abe is a world-renowned DPI loan platform with a market capitalization of about $2.5 billion.
Abe plays the role of a bank, and you can deposit coins to get interest, or vice versa, you can pay a certain amount of interest to get a loan.
Loans are made from a pool of assets deposited, not between individuals and individuals, and interest rates are not set. It depends on the supply and demand.
If most of the assets in the pool are borrowed, interest rates will increase depending on the algorithm to deposit more funds, and if the pool assets are rarely loaned, interest rates will be lowered to induce loans.

### 1-3. Insurance: Nexus Mutual (NXM)

Nexus Mutual is in charge of insurance and has a market capitalization of about $470 million.
It is a system that utilizes "smart contracts" that automatically sign contracts when certain conditions are fulfilled.
For example, Ethereum insurance is paid under the condition that "in the event of a car accident, you will be guaranteed 10 million won."
Insurance claims and settlement are automatically underway, and attempts are underway to combine damage assessments with artificial intelligence.
It is decided by DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, not an insurance company, and investors who participate in Dao receive compensation in return for the insurance company's work.
