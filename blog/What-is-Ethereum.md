## 1. What is Ethereum?

Ethereum, developed by Vitalic Buterin on July 30, 2015, is the most representative altcoin based on Bitcoin, also known as Bitcoin 2.0 and uses its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) like other blockchains.
While Bitcoin focuses on payment or transaction-related systems, that is, functions as currency,
Ethereum is a platform that provides scalability to transparently operate not only transactions and payments but also various applications such as contracts, SNS, e-mails, and electronic voting based on its core technology, blockchain, and allows anyone to create and use distributed applications called dApps.
Thanks to its high usability, various Ethereum-based tokens have been created, including Basic Attention Token (BAT) created by Firefox founders, Golem created by early Ethereum developers, and AUGUR, a predictive market platform.
Currently, it is considered one of the most likely coins to beat Bitcoin in the future and has a very high versatility compared to other altcoins.
The etymology of this lithium is said to have been created because they liked the word ether while searching for various SF-related terms.

### 1-1 Ethereum Classic?

The biggest difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is that it is a hard-forked virtual currency.
Ethereum was first issued on July 30, 2015, and Ethereum Classic was listed on July 24, 2016, and Ethereum Classic was created by hard-forking Ethereum because it felt unstable in the existing Ethereum.
"Hard Fork" is a measure taken when existing virtual currencies are kept secure with existing systems, but settings such as some errors or bugs are inevitably corrected or changed.
The hard fork hacked DAO on June 17, 2016, extorting 3.6 million Ethereum worth more than 63 billion won, but it did not suffer substantial damage from Ethereum developers' actions.
Starting from this, we introduced a hard fork, and the virtual currency before it was applied is the Ethereum Classic.

### 1-2. Ethereum's main technologies

- Solidity Language: It is a programming language built into the Ethereum platform and is a Turing language.
It was adopted to implement the smart contract function using Ethereum, and that a specific program language is evaluated as a 'turing complete language'
This program means that you can develop any application and solve any calculation formula.
Solidity is a language that can create algorithms for Turing machines.

- Ethereum virtual machine: Ethereum virtual machine refers to implementing a running environment in a blockchain.
Ethereum virtual machines can execute any complex algorithmic code, and Ethereum is a programmable blockchain that allows users to create their own tasks according to the complexity they want rather than providing a predefined set of tasks.
In a narrow sense, Ethereum refers to a series of protocols defining platforms for DApps, and Ethereum virtual machines are at the center of them.
Ethereum virtual machines can execute any complex algorithm code above, and developers can create applications running on Ethereum virtual machines using programming languages modeled after existing languages such as JavaScript and Python.

- Peer search: Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has a feature of recording transaction history on the P2P network while recording smart contracts and execution history.
When a block is created, smart contracts or remittances stored in the block are executed, and in order for nodes to become part of the network, they must be connected to other nodes in the network.
The reason why it is easy to find other nodes in the network even though there is no central server is because of its own node search with 반을 class in the Cadelima protocol.

- Transaction: In Ethereum, the term 'transaction' is used to represent a signed data package that stores messages to be sent from an externally owned account to another account in the blockchain.
Transactions include the following:
1. Message recipient.
2. A signature to check the sender.
3. The amount of Y-der to be transmitted.
4. Optional data fields that may contain messages sent to the contract.
5. Maximum number of operation steps allowed for transaction execution.
6. Expenses paid by the transaction sender for each operation step.
The above three items are values used as the standard for cryptocurrency, and the data field must include the limit and price of transaction fees called gas in all transactions.
